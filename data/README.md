# Data

This file should summarise the contents of the other files in this directory, which should be unprocessed and processed data from experiments.

**BE SURE TO NOT PUT ANY FILES IN HERE THAT MIGHT CONTAIN SENSITIVE INFORMATION!!!**

(Why should data files be tracked, anyway? Isn't git designed for use with text files only?)
